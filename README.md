# Tinder Effect - Practice Project

This project replicates the popular swipe functionality found in Tinder, developed as a hands-on exercise during the early stages of my JavaScript learning journey. Built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project demonstrates basic frontend techniques for implementing mobile-first interactive features.

## Key Features
- **Tinder-like swipe effect:** Allows users to swipe left or right on cards, mimicking the experience seen in dating apps.
- **Mobile responsive design:** Optimized for mobile devices; for desktop, use the developer tools in your browser and switch to mobile view.
- **No dependencies:** Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> **Note:** This project is not optimized for desktop responsiveness and should be viewed on mobile devices or in mobile mode via browser inspect tools.
